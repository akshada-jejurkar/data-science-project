# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – EDA 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand passenger survival patterns using **EDA** and builds machine learning models to predict survival.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value treatment (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
- Categorical vs Numerical data handling
- Visualizations:
  - Survival by gender
  - Survival by class
  - Age distribution
  - Correlation heatmap

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- Feature engineering (Title extraction, Family size, etc.)
- Models Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Dataset
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
